Todo:

- Some way to serialise and deserialise progress clock state for saving and loading (implement in Rust)
- Load progress clocks from (hardcoded for now) serialised data
- Start implementing session-oriented functionality
- Add some kind of regular "sync" to a remote server every few seconds (separate from the animation loop)
